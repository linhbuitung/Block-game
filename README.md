# Block-game

This is my Block-swapping game which I'm making to improve my JavaScript skills.

This game is purely Javascript and Dom manipulation

You can specify how many rows and collumns the puzzle will be, and the image that you want to use by using a link

The gameplay is 1 minute of swapping part-images until you run out of time or you recreate the original picture
